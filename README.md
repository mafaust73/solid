Computer Solid Geometry Library

Rewritten and extended version of [csg.js](https://github.com/evanw/csg.js) from Evan Wallace.

New features:

- ECMA 2015 syntax
- BSP plane selection algorithm changed
- New volume primitives
- Geometry exporters
- Unit tests with [Jest](http://jestjs.io/)

This is ongoing work and by the way, my first GitHub project.

Further documentation and examples are on their way.
